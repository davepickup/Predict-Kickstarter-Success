# Predict-Kickstarter-Success

Kickstarter is a community of more than 10 million people who help to bring creative projects to life.

More than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fueling these projects.
The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.

Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis i.e if a project doesn’t meet its goal, the project owner gets nothing.
For example: if a projects’s goal is $5000. Even if it gets funded till $4999, the project won’t be a success.


The goal of this project is to use data from previous projects to build a classifier to predict whether a future project will be successfully funded.

I've included a jupyter notebook for EDA, and model selection along with run.py and model.py scripts.
The run.py can be used to download the data and train the model, which ouputs a pickle file. There is also a small test set to predict on.
